        <p>This is the demo bottom navigation.</p>
        <p>
          On the left, it has some links that redirect to our platform, and on
          the right, it has a small copyright.

        <p>It was designed to be as simple as it may.</p>
        <p>
          Everything in this component is static, so you will need to manually
          change things if you want, so feel free to change this component as
          you wish.
